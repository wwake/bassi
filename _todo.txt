* Should Lexer be a Sequence? Yes, and IteratorProtocol too.
* Should Lexer work with [Character]? No, but we did clean up indexing.

GRAMMAR:
program -> line*

line -> line-number statement "\n"

line-number -> INTEGER(INT)

statement -> "REM" .*
statement -> "PRINT" expression?

expression -> subexpr (relop subexpr)?

subexpr -> term (("+"|"-") term)*

term -> power (("*"|"/") power)*

power -> "-" power
power -> factor ("^" factor)*

factor -> INTEGER(INT)
factor -> NUMBER(FLOAT)
factor -> "(" expression ")"

Number => [0-9]+("."[0-9]+)?([Ee][+-]?[0-9]+)?

Semantics:
* Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^) convert their arguments to "Float"
* Logical operators convert their arguments to "Short" - error if out of range
??? Does it truncate or round?
* Relationals convert numeric values to Float
* Strings can only work with relational operators
* Relationals can work with two numbers or two strings, but not mixed
