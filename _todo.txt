* DIM allows expressions in dimensions
* RND is repeatable when seed is non-0
* PRINT with ",":
  + Make output know next column to write
  + Make numbers print with trailing spaces, and with leading spaces if they're non-negative
  + comma at eol means don't print newline
  + tabs to column 0, 12, 24, ...
* Support the TAB() function - if past desired column, insert a newline


BI-22-32: June 23, 2022
* PRINT:
  + 10 PRINT: PRINT --fails (fixed)
  + Make trailing ";" suppress newline on PRINT
  + PRINT with multiple expressions
      25 PRINT "A" 4221    -- is legal - puts a space between them
  + PRINT with semicolon adds no space between items
  + PRINT with multiple expressions
      25 PRINT "A" 4221    -- is legal - puts a space between them
* PRINT with ";"
  + numbers have a space before and after
  + No space between strings

* BIG MILESTONE: Run Amazing (with some tweaks) and get a maze
* "Not yet implemented" should be "unexpected character" - error message from lexer - func testUnexpectedCharacters() in LexerTests
* Attempted: REPL should automatically scroll to bottom (not sure why it's not)
* DIM:
  + DIM should allow multiple declarations


BI-22-31: June 21, 2022

  + Make sure NEXT statements tests X+step (not just X)
  + Check properly nested loops
  + Make sure loop works when range not exceeded (normal case)
  + Make sure loop works for negative step values
  + Expressions in FOR-NEXT must be numeric

* Refactor: Straighten out use of type Int for LineNumber (used typealias)

BI-22-24: June 10, 2022
* FOR-NEXT
  + Test variable required in FOR
  + Test '=' required
  + Test 'TO' required
  + Test variable required in NEXT
  + NEXT checks for empty stack

  + FOR-NEXT skips body when the initial value is past the limit, with proper value in the variable

BI-22-23: June 9, 2022
* Handle parser errors better in interpreter
  + Should parser be generating .error? YES
  + There can only be one error message per line
  + Make interpreter handle errors through .error() parse
  + Do we want so many independent parser errors? NO
  + Make tokens know line & column number
  + Should lexer just handle spaces without normalization? NO

BI-22-22: June 8, 2022

  + "1 END" was interpreted as "1E" which is an invalid float

BI-22-08: May 19, 2022
* Precedence low to high: relational, NOT, AND, OR
* Add eol token to prevent - Program with plain PRINT will use line number of the next line eg
   20 PRINT
   30 PRINT 42
* Make parser check for end of line
    25 A = 42 21 "HI  -- error
