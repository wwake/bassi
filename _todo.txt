Semantics:
* Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^) convert their arguments to "Float"
* Logical operators convert their arguments to "Short" - error if out of range
??? Does it truncate or round?
* Relationals convert numeric values to Float

* Relationals can work with two numbers or two strings, but not mixed
